# Fictional Food Finder

## Project Description

The Fictional Food Finder allows users to be able to sign up or sign in to view nearby food trucks that are in their city. They can also take their location or a given location and find the closest truck nearby. Business owners for trucks will also be able to create or log in to edit their own profile and menu. Business owners will also be able to update their current menu, social media, business information, and location.

## Getting Started

First off, there are two repositories you will need to clone.  These are the two commands for cloning both repos.

The second repo can be accessed at this link: https://github.com/JwA-Digital-Stars/Frontend-Fictional-Food-Finder



git clone https://github.com/JwA-Digital-Stars/Fictional-Food-Finder.git

git clone https://github.com/JwA-Digital-Stars/Frontend-Fictional-Food-Finder

After that, you will need to have an EC2 set up on AWS as well as a S3 Bucket. Once you have those, make sure Java 8, and Jenkins is installed on that EC2.
