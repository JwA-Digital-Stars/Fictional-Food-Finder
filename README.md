## Getting Started

First off, there are two repositories you will need to clone.  These are the two commands for cloning both repos.

The second repo can be accessed at this link: https://github.com/JwA-Digital-Stars/Frontend-Fictional-Food-Finder



git clone https://github.com/JwA-Digital-Stars/Fictional-Food-Finder.git

git clone https://github.com/JwA-Digital-Stars/Frontend-Fictional-Food-Finder

After that, you will need to have an EC2 set up on AWS as well as a S3 Bucket. Once you have those, make sure Java 8, and Jenkins is installed on that EC2.
